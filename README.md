# Clone your repository
1. - [ ] Clone the existing repository you created via GitHub Classroom.
2. - [ ] Use Unity Hub to create a new 2D Unity project named ASSIGNMENT NAME *inside* the repository you just cloned.  Be sure to set the location for the project as the new Repo folder.  
3. - [ ] Once the project opens in Unity, go to File Explorer and Move the **_UnityProjectRoot.gitignore** file up into your **Unity project** folder and rename to **.gitignore**
4. - [ ] In GitHub Desktop, click commit. Make sure that your project files show up and number of files is reasonable (should **not** be 10's of thousands of files).
   a.	If you have thousands of changed files, return to step 2 to make sure youâ€™ve named the gitignore file properly and that it is placed at the root of the Unity project not in its original location.  Ask for help if you are unsure.
5. - [ ] Push your changes to the remote.
